Confpack Development Environment
================================

In order to keep everyone's development environment constnat, this repository
sets up all the vagrant stuff needed. In order to work on confpack related
projects, clone the repository into the `src` folder and work from in there.

That folder is ignored by this git repository, so you should be able to use
your git tools just fine.

Example setup:

    $ git clone https://github.com/confpack/vagrant.git confpack
    $ cd confpack/src
    $ git clone https://github.com/confpack/runtime.git

This should give you:

confpack/
  src/
    runtime/
      ...
  Vagranfile
  README
